		<p class="Jartist">Jette is a social, 20-year old designer with interests going from illustration to coding. She sees herself as lively, passionate, and curious - And itâ€™s true, Jette is passionate about a lot of things. She is interested many different subcultures and especially their music. When she was younger she learned about a wide range of music from her parents. Punk, folk, soul, you name it, and this interest has only been growing from there. She is intrigued by every person no matter who they are or what their beliefs are. She tries to learn from them and in this way find her own place in the world.</p>
		<p class="Jartist">In terms of art and design is Jette all about experimentation. With every project there will be a new approach. Nothing will be done twice. Jette was always more comfortable with 2D analog and media, but she has been broadening her horizon with 3D works, installations and digital work. For example this website, which was coded entirely from scratch!</p>
